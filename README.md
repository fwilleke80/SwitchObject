# SwitchObject

An object plugin that allows switching visibility of object groups. This allows for easily configurable setups, like exchanging tires on a car, pickups on a guitar, et cetera.

Aspiring plugin developers can learn - amongst other things - the following from the code:
* Object plugins derived from `class ObjectData`
* Dynamic user interfaces in the Attribute Manager (the complete UI is build dynamically in the code)
* Working with `class Description` and `DescID`
